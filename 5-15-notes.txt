Explain what pegasos is dong
Explain what the neural net is doing
write down differences between pegasos and neural net
pegasos penalizes weights squared
neural net constrains weights to 1/-1

Experiments with synthetic data - comparison of weights and convergence
how do neural net and svm weights converge?
how do they compare to each other for a given data set?
try using synthetic data for comparison

try solving the linear svm optimization equation for synthetic data
W*x turns into Whigh * xhigh + Wlow * hlow + Wbackground * xbackground
can use means from x because w should be same for all identical-p bernoulli variables


on the synthetic data, the neural net converges to a certain amount of synapses
being the "wrong" value - why? and compare to SVM


after doing the synthetic data comparisons, do this on real data on show that it's
similar
